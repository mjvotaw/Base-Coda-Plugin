# Base-Coda-Plugin
A basic helper class for making Coda Plugins 

## What is this?
BaseCodaPlugin is a starting point for (hopefully) making plugin development for Coda 2/2.5 slightly easier. 
If you're not familiar with Coda, [check it out](http://panic.com/coda/), and check out their official [Plugin Kit](https://github.com/panicinc/CodaPluginKit).

The class itself offers many helper methods for performing basic, but somewhat tedious, actions, and the example plugin project shows the basic setup of a Coda Plug-in.
Eventually, I'll fill the rest of this out with more information.
